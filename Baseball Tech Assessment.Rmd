### Purpose
Analyze and organize vertical bat angle

```{r Q2 part 1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Calculate the mean vertical bat angle for each batter-batter side pair
agg_vertical_bat_angle <- aggregate(VERTICAL_BAT_ANGLE ~ BATTER_ID + BATTER_SIDE, data = vertical_bat_angle, FUN = mean)

# Sort the dataset based on the aggregated vertical bat angle in ascending order
sorted_agg_vertical_bat_angle <- agg_vertical_bat_angle[order(agg_vertical_bat_angle$VERTICAL_BAT_ANGLE), ]

## Sorting this way means players with the flatter swings on average will be at the end of the list while players with steeper swings will be at the top


# Display the leaderboard
leaderboard <- sorted_agg_vertical_bat_angle[c('BATTER_ID', 'BATTER_SIDE', 'VERTICAL_BAT_ANGLE')]
# print(leaderboard)
write.csv(leaderboard, "C://Users/jaker/OneDrive/Desktop/Professional Development/Technical Assessments/Tech Assessment/leaderboard.csv")

# Set thresholds related to Blast Motion data
thresholds <- c(-24, -35)

# Create a graph to display distribution of vertical bat angles in a histogram
distribution_plot <- ggplot(leaderboard, aes(x = VERTICAL_BAT_ANGLE)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = thresholds, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1.5) +
  labs(title = "Vertical Bat Angle Distribution Graph",
       x = "Values",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
    annotate("text", x = min(leaderboard$VERTICAL_BAT_ANGLE), y = Inf, hjust = 0, vjust = 1, 
           label = "Note: The thresholds set at
           -24 and -35 degrees

### Need to group by Pitcher 
# Step 2: Create a Subset for Relevant Columns
relevant_columns <- c("PITCH_ID", "PITCHER_ID", "PITCHER_THROWS", "WEIGHT", "VELOCITY", "FRAME", "BALL_RELEASE", "FORCE_X", "FORCE_Y", "FORCE_Z", "TORQUE_Z")

force_plate_data_subset <- force_plate_data %>% 
  select(relevant_columns)

# Step 3: Calculate Peak Forces and Torque
force_plate_data_peaks <- force_plate_data_subset %>% 
  group_by(PITCH_ID, PITCHER_ID) %>% 
  summarize(
    Peak_FORCE_X = max(FORCE_X),
    Peak_FORCE_Y = max(FORCE_Y),
    Peak_FORCE_Z = max(FORCE_Z),
    Peak_TORQUE_Z = max(TORQUE_Z),
    VELOCITY = first(VELOCITY),  # Assuming velocity is constant for each pitch
    WEIGHT = first(WEIGHT)       # Assuming weight is constant for each pitch
  )

#Step 4: Join the Peak Values with Velocity and Weight
peaks_merged <- force_plate_data_peaks %>%
  left_join(force_plate_data_subset %>% filter(FRAME == BALL_RELEASE), by = c("PITCH_ID", "PITCHER_ID")) %>%
  select(PITCH_ID, PITCHER_ID, VELOCITY.x = "VELOCITY", WEIGHT.x = "WEIGTH", Peak_FORCE_X, Peak_FORCE_Y, Peak_FORCE_Z, Peak_TORQUE_Z)

# Step 5: Calculate Correlation
peak_correlations <- cor(force_plate_data_peaks[, c("VELOCITY", "WEIGHT", "Peak_FORCE_X", "Peak_FORCE_Y", "Peak_FORCE_Z", "Peak_TORQUE_Z")])
